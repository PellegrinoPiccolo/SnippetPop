## 🏗️ How the Sync Works

SnippetPop uses a unique **two-layer** architecture:

1. **The Compass (`rootStore`)**: A local configuration that remembers where your library is located.
2. **The Treasure (`snippetpop-data.json`)**: The actual file containing all your snippets.

### Why is this great?
When you change the library folder, the app migrates your data to the new location (like your Google Drive folder) and restarts. If you install SnippetPop on another computer and select the same folder, it detects the existing data and loads it instantly.
